        <p>Hello! My name is Sinclair Hansen and I'm a Computer Science student at Schoolcraft College preparing to 
          transfer to a four-year university next Fall. I possess skills in Python and C++ (OOP) from coursework.
          I also actively engage with HTML, CSS, and Pytorch in my free time. My aim is to specialize in AI and ML. In my free time 
        I'm an active member on campus. I am the student leader of the math and physics club and a math tutor at Schoolcraft's 
        learning center. I consistently strive to learn more about programming, so feel free to check out my current projects!</p>

          <p> Future Coders Foundation is a non-profit I am currently co-developing, with the goal of providing
          coding resources to students that don't have them. Website is under construction; </p>

          <p> This is a Machine Learning program I made using Pytorch. The program identifies playing cards and displays results using
          matplotlib. </p>

          <p> I made a weather app using Python. The program imports weahter data using OpenWeather API and displays weather results for users.
          The goal going forward is to update the UI and to made a 7-day forecast. </p>

          <p> This is a portfolio website that I developed for a small buisiness called 'Not Too Shabby'. It showcases
          furniture projects and utilizes basic website nagivation. My goal going forward with this project is to make it
          more mobile-friendly.</p>
