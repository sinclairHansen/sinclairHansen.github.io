  <h3>“The flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil can lead to a hurricane in Texas.”</h3>
  <p>While not meant to be taken literally, 
    this metaphor captures the essence of <b>chaos theory</b>: small 
    changes in the initial conditions of a system can lead to large and 
    unpredictable outcomes. This idea, often referred to as the butterfly effect, 
    lies at the heart of chaos theory and highlights the sensitive dependence on initial 
    conditions seen in many natural and mathematical systems.</p>
  <p class="space">Chaos Theory states that within the apparent 
    randomness of chaotic, complex systems, there are 
    underlying patterns, interconnectedness, constant feedback loops,
     repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization. In simple
      terms, even though these systems may appear unpredictable, they follow
       deeper rules. Small changes in initial conditions can lead to drastically
        different outcomes as time progresses, making long-term prediction 
        extremely difficult.</p>
  <p>One common example of a chaotic system is a 
    double pendulum. A double pendulum’s position can be found 
    using deterministic equations. When given a set of initial
     values, we can predict where it will be at any given time. 
     So why is it an example of a chaotic system? A double pendulum
      is an example of deterministic chaos. We would be able to calculate 
      its position if we had precise data, but that can be hard to come by. 
      The position of the double pendulum is extremely sensitive, and a change
       in significant figures can completely change its trajectory. This can be
        shown in the double pendulum at the top of the article. Ten pendulums 
        are displayed, with the only difference is each theta value increases 
        by 0.001º. Within a few seconds we see that all the pendulums break off 
        into completely different pathways. A quote that describes this well
         comes from Edward Lorenz, a mathematician that laid the foundations of
          chaos theory:</p>


<h3>Chaos: When the present determines the future but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.</h3>
<h2>The History of Chaos Theory</h2>
<p>The idea of Chaos Theory stems from mathematician 
  and meteorologist Edward Lorenz in the 1960s. Throughout his work 
  as a meteorologist, he came to the conclusion that weather patterns are nonlinear 
  and can be volatile. This was enforced when one day he decided to go back and recreate a 
  past weather sequence. When he initially made the calculations a year prior, he used six significant 
  figures, but when running through them again he used three. One would expect this decimal change to be
   insignificant, but that was far from the truth. The two weather sequences were vastly different, 
   showing that seemingly negligible factors can completely change outcomes (Halton). </p>

 <h2>The Lorenz Attractor</h2>
 <h4><a class = "button" href = "LorenzAttractor/lorenz.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D Lorenz Attractor</a></h4>

<p>Lorenz is well known for the 
  famous Lorenz Attractor, a model often associated 
  with the Butterfly Effect, appropriately named because its
   shape resembles a butterfly. What makes this set of equations
    notable is its extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. 
    The three differential equations are:</p>
   <img class ="floatImage" src="../Images/lorenzAttractor.gif"   alt="Lorenz Attractor">
  <div class="space">
    <p class="center"><b>x' = σ(y - x)</b></p>
    <p class="center"><b>y' = (ρ - z) - y</b></p>
    <p class="center"><b>z' = xy - ßz</b> </p>
  </div>


  <p>The values <b>σ </b>(sigma),  <b>ρ </b>(rho), and <b>ß</b> (beta), 
    are constants that can be changed, but picking random numbers
     will likely result in the particles flying towards infinity. 
     The most common constants, picked by Lorenz himself are:</p>

  <div class="space">
    <p class="center"><b>σ = 10 ρ = 28  ß = ⁠8/3</b></p>
  </div>

  <p>Starting from an arbitrary point, 
    future points are calculated based on the previous. 
    It is important to note that not all inputs in this equation 
    result in a chaotic output. For example, having initial values 
    (0,0,0) will result in all derivatives equaling 0. The point will
     forever stay at the origin. On the flip side, inputting large values
      will result in the particle shooting towards infinity. The most
       interesting behavior happens when we pick starting points in a certain 
       "sweet spot."</p>
  <p>As part of my research, I programmed a 3D 
    model of the Lorenz Attractor, viewable through 
    the button below. I initialized the point at (0.01, 0, 0)
     to ensure non zero derivatives and a true chaotic attractor.</p>
    <p class="space">What’s fascinating about this model is that 
      the trajectory never exactly retraces its steps. If it 
      did, the motion would no longer be chaotic; it would become 
      periodic or predictable. Even more interestingly, if we start 100
       points close together, some will eventually diverge widely, but many
        will stay trapped in the attractor’s general shape. Even though they 
        follow similar patterns, no two paths are identical. A tiny difference
         in starting points leads to drastically different futures (Kastorf).</p>



    <h2 class="center">Math Behind the Double Pendulum</h2>
    <p>The orientation of a double pendulum can be shown on the right. When doing calculations, we have several variables we will be working with:</p>



  <h2 class="center">Applications of Chaos Theory</h2>
  <p>The findings in Chaos Theory have many real world applications. 
    Many of the systems we use in our day-to-day lives are chaotic, unpredictable, and 
    reliant on initial conditions. Examples include weather patterns, economics, and artificial 
    intelligence. The goal of using Chaos Theory in these fields is to find order in messy systems 
    (Geeks for Geeks).</p>
