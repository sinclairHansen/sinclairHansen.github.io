          <p>I joined Schoolcraft's Honors Program. Through the program I am given the opportunity to work with professors on class-related projects.
            Since being in the program I have built a Rubik's cube timer in C++, written a Psychology literature review and worked with my statistics professor
            on a data-visualization project.
